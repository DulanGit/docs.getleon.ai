# Introduction

## What is Leon?

Leon is an open-source personal assistant who can live on your server.

He does stuff when you ask for it.

You can talk to him and he can talk to you.
You can also text him and he can also text you.
If you want to, Leon can communicate with you offline to protect your privacy.

You can think about him as a second brain.

::: tip  
Leon is still pretty young today. If you wish, you can help by [contributing](https://github.com/leon-ai/leon/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
