# Introduction

## What is Leon?

Leon is an open-source personal assistant who can live on your server.

He does stuff when you ask for it.

You can talk to him and he can talk to you.
You can also text him and he can also text you.
If you want to, Leon can communicate with you by being offline to protect your privacy.

You can think of him as a second brain.

::: tip
Leon is still pretty young today. If you wish, you can help by [contributing](https://github.com/leon-ai/leon/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) <3

## Motivations

1. As developers (or not), we **love creating** things, even more when those things can **help** in our **daily life**. So instead of building a dedicated project for each of those things, Leon can help us with his **packages/modules** (skills) structure. We believe it's better than keeping your awesome ideas in backlog forever, right?
2. With this generic structure, **everyone** can **create** his own **modules** and **share them**. Therefore there is only one core (to govern all of them).
3. Leon uses **AI concepts**, which is cool.
4. **Privacy matters**, you can configure Leon to talk with him **offline**. You can already **text** with him **without** any **third party** services.
5. Last but not least: **open-source** is great.

## Prerequisites

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 10**
> Leon's core is developed on the top of the Node.js JavaScript runtime.
- **npm >= 5**
> npm is the packages manager of Node.js, Leon needs it for his core's dependencies tree.
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.6.x**
> Today, Leon's modules are only written in Python.
- **[Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org)**
> Pipenv allows Leon's modules to be executed in a dedicated environment. It also embeds a Python packages manager for the dependencies tree of his modules.
- **Supported OSes: Linux, macOS and Windows**
> Should we explain that one? :)
