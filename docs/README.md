# Introduction

## What is Leon?

Leon is an open-source personal assistant who can live on your server.

He does stuff when you ask for it.

You can talk to him and he can talk to you.
You can also text him and he can also text you.
If you want to, Leon can communicate with you offline to protect your privacy.

You can think about him as a second brain.

::: tip
Leon is still pretty young today. If you wish, you can help by [contributing](https://github.com/leon-ai/leon/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Motivations

1. As developers (or not), we love creating things, even more when those things can help in our daily life. So instead of building a dedicated project for each of those things, Leon can help us with his packages/modules (skills) structure. We believe it's better than keeping your awesome ideas in backlog forever, right?
2. With this generic structure, everyone can create his own modules and share it with others. Therefore, there is only one core (to govern all of them).
3. Leon uses AI concepts, which is cool.
4. Privacy matters, you can configure Leon to talk with him offline. You can already text with him without any third party services.
5. Last but not least: open-source is great.
